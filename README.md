# Addons
## Install addon
To install these Addons you need to download the folder for the addon you want and place it within the addons folder for WoW classic. 

"Some drive":\"some path"\World of Warcraft\_classic_\Interface\AddOns

Once the addon is in this folder you can start WoW and find it in the addons list

## Current addons and how it works


This addon saves the guildmembers into a global variable that is stored in a file 

```
"Some drive":\"some path"\World of Warcraft\_classic_\WTF\Account\"Account"#"acount number"\SavedVariables\"name of addon".lua
```

Example:

```
D:\Games\World of Warcraft\_classic_\WTF\Account\114194990#1\SavedVariables\GuildMembers.lua
```
